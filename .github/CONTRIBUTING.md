## üìå High-level rules

- The integration branch is `develop`. All contributions must be based on `develop` and opened as PRs targeting `develop`.
- Every PR must pass the full CI pipeline before it can be merged (linting, type checks, unit tests, mutation tests, acceptance tests).
- Branch names and commit messages must follow the defined conventions (see below).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please always target `develop` for PRs. `main` is protected and reserved for releases; PRs to `main` will be rejected.

---

## ‚úÖ Quick checklist

- [ ] Fork the repository on GitHub
- [ ] Clone your fork locally
- [ ] Create a branch from `develop` following the branch naming rules
- [ ] Run local checks (typecheck, unit tests, mutation tests if possible)
- [ ] Use Conventional Commits for commit messages
- [ ] Open a PR from your branch (on your fork) ‚Üí target `develop` on upstream
- [ ] Ensure CI checks pass and address review comments

---

## üöÄ Getting started (commands)

> [!NOTE]
> This repo uses pnpm (see `package.json`).

### Clone and prepare

```bash
# clone your fork (replace <your-username>)
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/goat-it-api.git
cd goat-it-api

# add the upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/antoinezanardi/goat-it-api.git
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Create a working branch from `develop`

```bash
# update local develop from upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout -B develop upstream/develop

# create your feature branch
git checkout -b feat/short-description
```

### Helper script (optional)

You can use the included helper script to create a branch with validation in a guided flow.

```bash
pnpm run script:create-branch
```

---

## üîç Local checks to run before opening a PR

Run these locally to speed up iteration ‚Äî CI will run them again.

### Type-check

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
```

### Unit tests

> [!NOTE]
> Code coverage is set to a minimum threshold of 100%.

```bash
pnpm run test:unit
# coverage
pnpm run test:unit:cov
```

### Mutation tests (heavy ‚Äî can be slow)

> [!WARNING]
> Mutation testing is expensive and can take a long time locally. If you cannot run mutation tests on your machine, rely on CI for final verification ‚Äî but aim to run unit tests and type checks locally before pushing.

> [!TIP]
> Use `pnpm run test:mutation` for incremental runs during development and `pnpm run test:mutation:ci` in CI contexts.

```bash
pnpm run test:mutation
```

### Build

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Branch name validation (same validation as CI)

```bash
pnpm run validate:branch-name
```

---

## üåø Branching rules

- Always branch from the latest `develop`.
- `main` is protected for production; do not open PRs against `main`.
- Branch names must follow the validation config at `configs/validate-branch-name/.validate-branch-namerc.json`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Branch names that do not match the configured pattern will be rejected by CI and/or hooks. Validate locally with `pnpm run validate:branch-name` before pushing.

### Pattern (regex)

```regex
^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|perf|build|ci|chore|revert)/.+$
```

### Examples

- ‚úÖ `feat/add-login-endpoint`
- ‚úÖ `fix/calc-rounding-error`
- ‚úÖ `docs/update-readme`
- ‚ùå `feature/add-login` (use `feat`)
- ‚ùå `Add-login` (missing type)
- ‚ùå `feat_add_login` (must use `/`)

### Validate locally

```bash
pnpm run validate:branch-name
```

> [!TIP]
> The repo includes a helper script (`scripts/create-git-branch.sh`) if you prefer a guided flow.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Commit messages & PR titles (Conventional Commits)

We use Conventional Commits. Commit messages and PR titles should follow the Conventional Commits header format. The repo's commitlint config is in `configs/commitlint/.commitlintrc.json` (it extends `@commitlint/config-conventional`). CI enforces these rules.

### Header format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

### Optional body, optional breaking change, and footer

```text
<optional body>

BREAKING CHANGE: <description>

Closes #<issue-number>
```

### Allowed common types

- `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

### Examples

```text
feat(auth): add JWT refresh endpoint
```

```text
fix(payment): handle rounding error in total calculation

  Adjusted the aggregation to round at the end to avoid floating point drift.
```

### Breaking change example

```text
feat(api)!: remove legacy /v1 endpoints

This removes the v1 endpoints. Consumers must migrate to /v2.
```

### PR title rule

- The PR title should be a valid Conventional Commit header (the same format as the first line of a commit). When possible, use the same string as the main commit or the eventual squashed commit message. Maintainers may reword/squash on merge but will keep the final commit Conventional.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Commit messages and PR titles are enforced by `commitlint`. Non-conforming messages will cause CI failures. Use interactive rebase to correct message history before pushing if needed.

### Validate commit messages locally (optional)

```bash
# validate the message saved in .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
npx --no-install @commitlint/cli --config configs/commitlint/.commitlintrc.json --edit .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
```

### Notes

- If CI rejects commit messages, use interactive rebase to edit them locally before pushing.
- Keep commits focused; maintainers may request squashing before merge.

---

## üö¶ CI & merging

- All PRs must pass the CI checks before merge (lint, typecheck, unit tests, mutation tests, acceptance tests).
- If CI fails, fix locally, push, and wait for re-run. Your PR won't be merged until CI is green.
- Maintainers will merge into `develop` once reviews pass and CI is green. Release automation handles promotion to `main`.
- Please avoid force-pushing to shared branches after reviews start, as it can disrupt the review process.

---

## üîí Security

- Never commit secrets or credentials. Use environment variables and CI secret storage.

> [!CAUTION]
> Committing secrets (API keys, credentials, private keys) can expose systems and cause security incidents. If you accidentally commit a secret, rotate it immediately and notify maintainers.

---

## üêï Husky & git hooks

This repository uses Husky hooks stored in the `.husky/` directory to enforce some checks before commits are accepted locally.

> [!NOTE]
> Husky is configured in the repo and the hook scripts live in `.husky/` ‚Äî you can inspect them directly if needed.

### Current hooks

- `.husky/commit-msg` ‚Äî runs commitlint to validate commit messages:

  ```bash
  npx commitlint --config configs/commitlint/.commitlintrc.json --edit "$1"
  ```

  This ensures commit messages follow the Conventional Commits rules configured in `configs/commitlint/.commitlintrc.json`.

- `.husky/pre-commit` ‚Äî validates branch names and runs linting/tests on staged files:

  ```bash
  <package-manager> run validate:branch-name
  <package-manager> run lint:staged:fix
  <package-manager> run test:unit:staged
  ```

  (You can run the same validation locally listed above. Use `<package-manager>` as `pnpm` or `npm` here.)

### Bypassing hooks

> [!CAUTION]
> Bypassing hooks with `--no-verify` skips important checks. Only use `git commit --no-verify` or `git push --no-verify` if you have a compelling reason or documented exception, and you understand the risks.

If you must bypass hooks temporarily (for example, when the checks are causing problems during a quick experimental commit):

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "chore: temporary commit"
```

> [!WARNING]
> Resolve issues locally instead of bypassing hooks. The hooks exist to keep the repo healthy and to match CI expectations.
> CI will still run the checks on pushed commits, so bypassing hooks only affects local commits.

---

## üß∞ Additional tips

- Prefer small, focused PRs for faster review.
- Open a draft PR early for large work to gather feedback.
- Document any new config or runtime env in the README.
- `CODEOWNERS` currently designates `@antoinezanardi` as the default owner for the repository ‚Äî maintainers will be requested as reviewers automatically where applicable.
